# Task-Management-App

This is a rudimentary Flask app that allows you to add and delete tasks to a list of tasks. It states the name and dated added to the list. (There is an update function, which has a bug I am in the mind of fixing.)

As with any Flask app, you will need to create your env and run it through that env while testing.
